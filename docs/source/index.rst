Welcome to ReMKiT1D Python Support's documentation!
===================================================

RMK_support is a collection of tools designed to configure and analyze ReMKiT1D runs. ReMKiT1D is a Fortran framework for building multi-fluid models in 1D with reaction and kinetic electron support, aimed primarily at simulating the tokamak Scrape-Off Layer. 

This documentation is written to serve as a general user manual both for the support package as well as the framework in general, which should, together with the examples available in the repository and explanations in the dedicated code paper, provide a full picture of the capabilities and use of the ReMKiT1D packages.
