The two notebooks rendered here can be considered as tutorials covering everything from setting up the config file to analyzing the resulting output data. 

.. note:: 

    Note that to reproduce the results presented here ReMKiT1D must be run separately with the config.json files produced. See the Fortran repository documentation for how to run ReMKiT1D.

.. note:: 
    
    Unfortunately, the interactive dashboard couldn't be rendered in this example. The user is referred to the notebooks themselves, including the ReMKiT1D_analysis notebook, which has multiple different examples of how to quickly visualize data using the dashboard and holoviews and xarray features.
