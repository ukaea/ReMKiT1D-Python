    "\n",
    "This is accomplished through custom model objects, and this notebook is meant to serve as a detailed tutorial and documentation for the fluid custom model case. \n",

    "The problem dealt with will be a 2-fluid system, fully coupling ions and electrons with Bohm outflow boundary conditions and with particle and energy sources. The method used is a collocated finite volume method, and the ringing that results from this can be seen in the solution. However, the point of this notebook is to provide detailed examples of how one would go about doing practically relevant model construction using ReMKiT1D. Staggered grid examples for both fluid and kinetic models are available in other notebooks, where comments are sparser.\n"

    "Each term is identified by a tag used to provide it with options, and a model can have any number of terms. General terms are of the form $cX(x)T(t)M_{ij}u_j$, where i and j are row and column indices (summation implied) associated with the evolved and implicit variables. $X$ and $T$ are functions only of the spatial cell and the \"time\" variable, while $c$ is a constant. The main term matrix $M_{ij}$ is further assumed to be of the form $R_iC_jS_{ij}$, where $R$ and $C$ are row and column components which are simple products of variables raised to corresponding powers, e.g. $R = \\prod_n v_n^{p_n}$ ($R$ can also contain evaluation results of other term groups - see below). Finally, the main structure of the term resides in the \"stencil\" component $S_{ij}$, the options for which will be reviewed below. For the currently implemented Picard iteration Backwards Euler implicit integrator, $T$ and $M$ are updated at each iteration using variable values from the previous one, while $u$ is fully implicit. \n",

    "### Manipulator options \n",
    "\n",
    "Manipulators are flexible objects used to manipulate data outside of standard integration and derivation options. Below is an example of how to create an evaluator type manipulator and use it to access the evaluated electron-ion energy exchange term by evaluation the corresponding model and term group, as well as a modelbound data extractor type to get the  Coulomb log from the same model. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of manipulators is their priority, determining when they will be called: \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Manipulator is called on all internal integrator iterations (nonlinear BDE iterations in this case)\n",
    "1. Manipulator is called at the end of each (internal) timestep (in any one integration step)\n",
    "2. Manipulator is called at the end of each integration step (here there is only one integration step and no internal step timestep control so 1 and 2 behave the same)\n",
    "3. Manipulator is called at the end of each integration call (global timestep)\n",
    "4. Manipulator is called before data writing to HDF5 file\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, whenever a manipulator call is made with a given priority all manipulators with priority <= the call priority will be invoked.\n",
